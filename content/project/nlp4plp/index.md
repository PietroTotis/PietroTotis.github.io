This project aims to build a system capable of solving probabilistic and combinatorial problems from questions formulated in natural language. We are working on a dataset composed of common textbook problems that cover a wide range of situations and structures. An example:

> In a classroom there are 14 boys and 12 girls. 6 students are randomly selected for a school project: what is the probability that at least half of them are girls?

A sample of the data can be downloaded from the project page on [Problog's website](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/natural_language/).

This project was born from the IJCAI paper [Solving Probability Problems in Natural Language](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/583588/1/nlp4plp.pdf) and today we colaborate with the [CLiPS](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/) research center on the natural language processing part.
