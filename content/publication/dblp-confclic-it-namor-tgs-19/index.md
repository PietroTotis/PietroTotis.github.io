abstract: 'We present the first model for argumentation mining for Italian short  argumentative texts. We adapted to Italian the software developed by (Peldszus and Stede, 2015) and built a suitable corpus of Italian \"microtexts\" by semi-automatically translating the original English corpus. Our results are  comparable to those of (Peldszus and Stede, 2015), which proves that their model    is applicable successfully to languages other than English and German.'
