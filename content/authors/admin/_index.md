#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently part of the [AI Research team](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/about) at JP Morgan Chase & Co. as Senior Research Associate.
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the DTAI Lab of the Department of Computer Science of [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), under the supervision of professor [Luc De Raedt](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~luc.deraedt/). My research was also supervised by professors [Jesse Davis](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/) and [Angelika Kimmig](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/634329-kimmig-angelika) (DTAI Lab).

My main PhD project was [Solving Combinatorial and Probabilistic Problems in Natural Language](https://www.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/portaal/#/projecten/3E180082?lang=en&hl=en), which aims to build a system capable of understanding and solving probability and combinatorial problems expressed in natural language.
Other lines of research included Probabilistic Logic Programming, Knowledge Compilation and Argumentation.

My Bachelor and Master education took place in Udine (Italy), with an Erasmus period of 6 months at the University of Potsdam.
