I am currently part of the AI Research team at J.P. Morgan as Senior Research Associate.
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the DTAI Lab of the Department of Computer Science of [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), under the supervision of professor [Luc De Raedt](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~luc.deraedt/). My research was also supervised by professors [Jesse Davis](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/) and [Angelika Kimmig](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/634329-kimmig-angelika) (DTAI Lab).

My main PhD project was [Solving Combinatorial and Probabilistic Problems in Natural Language](https://www.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/portaal/#/projecten/3E180082?lang=en&hl=en), which aims to build a system capable of understanding and solving probability and combinatorial problems expressed in natural language.
Other lines of research included Probabilistic Logic Programming, Knowledge Compilation and Argumentation.

My Bachelor and Master education took place in Udine (Italy), my hometown, with an Erasmus period of 6 months at the University of Potsdam.
